This project is a skeleton for candidate's homework as part of the job application process.

### Requirements ###
The skeleton includes a simple page with an HTML5 video element and placeholders for functionality you will need to implement: 

* Play/Pause toggle functionality
* Progress indication - update the time label as the video plays
* Views counter
* Like/Dislike functionality - click to to update counter

Use [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/) to implement the views and like/dislike across sessions and viewers.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup a local dev env (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
* Signup for [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) free account
* Get the skeleton (clone the repo or simply [download](https://bitbucket.org/interludedevs/candidatehomework/downloads) as a zip file)
* Deploy the skeleton's files into the dev env
* Start coding!

### What are we looking for? ###

* Code that works according to the requirements
* Understanding of Javascript fundamentals
* A modular design (we strongly recommend using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/))
* Attention to detail
* Abilities to self learn how to work with new APIs and webservices
* Clear, beautiful and properly documented code

Nice to have:

* Make the video controls prettier ([Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) would be highly appreciated)  
* Unit tests (give [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) a try)


### How do I submit? ###

Simply send us a zip file.

## Good luck! ##
